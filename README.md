It is 2016 and America has a big problem. No, it's not Zika or Ebola. Not even Donald Trump or this election. America is facing its toughest conflict in 50 years: the clown epidemic. Hundreds of (probably murderous) clowns have come out of hiding to terrorize and scare innocent Americans across the country and, until now, there was nothing we can do. 

No. More.

Node Clowning Around is an app designed for General Motors' "Next Generation Infotainment" sdk. This web-based automobile application allows users to report clown sightings, making the world a safer place. These can be viewed in real-time from within the app and also from our Azure-based web application.
